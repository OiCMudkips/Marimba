# marimba

This is the UW Concert Band Club's mailing list/finances management program, originally developed by Lawrence Veregin.

## Getting started
1. Install Visual Studio from Microsoft.

    Download the community version (free) from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com and install it. You can leave all the defaults as is.  If you encounter any issues with the latest version, try Visual Studio 2015.

2. Install Visual Studio Installer Projects extension

    Find the one made for the version of Visual Studio that you've installed from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com. You'll need this extension to create an installer for Marimba.

3. Setup the Visual Studio projects.

    Ask the previous developer of Marimba to add you to the uwcbc organization. To actually get the code, install a git client and clone the repo. To open the project, double click the .sln file in the new uwcbc-marimba folder. Everything should be working at this point! If not, ask the previous developer.

4. OPTIONAL: Integrate Visual Studio with Git.

    Ideally, you should be able to check-in and check-out changes directly in Visual Studio. This is up to whether you like the convenience of an IDE doing things for you, or like using a shell to run git commands.
